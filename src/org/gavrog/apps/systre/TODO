=====================================================

Open bugs/issues:

- class cast exception when saving files with "All Files" type option
- unit cell parameter space computation can 'freeze' (via Greg McColm)
- space group difference reported when monoclinic setting differs

=====================================================

For the coming release:

=====================================================

Planned/requested features:

Next version (Gavrog 0.7.0):
- If possible, implement a more general test for ladders.

- Convert coordinates in parser error messages back to original unit cell.
- Avoid negative coordinates in output. (?)
- Issue warning if output has vertex collisions.
- Analyse ladders similarly to interpenetrating nets.

- Optionally merge vertices with identical neighbor sets.
- Option to stop on error.
- Produce a log file when using GUI version in non-stop mode.

- Better phrasing when component has multiple translates.
- Make choice of output formats more self-explanatory.


Later:
- Support global node repulsion in embedder.

- Command line version can write cgd files.
- Option to simplify graphs with 1- or 2-coordinated nodes.
- Check for edge intersections and similar problems.
- Compute vertex symbols.
- If graph has collisions, try to refine anyway.

- Print parametric positions for nodes and edge centers.
- Make SystreGUI accept command line arguments.
- Introduce keyboard shortcuts.
- Link to online databases.
- Support more output options (e.g. CrystalMaker).
- Plot the quotient graph.
- Report induced symmetries from "given" (or report none at all) for components.
