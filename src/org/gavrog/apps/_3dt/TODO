=====================================================

Open bugs:

- Sometimes unit cells are very flat.
- Disabling and enabling of menu items is missing or clumsily implemented.

=====================================================

For the coming release:

- for face list tiling, restore to originally given symmetry

=====================================================

Planned/requested features:

- Export embedding.
- Option to add tile coronas.

- Report number of tiles per repeat unit / unit cell.
- Undo/Redo.
- Extend to support nets in all reasonable ways.
- Allow separate colors and visibility for individual faces.
- Recoloring and changing size of individual and kinds of vertices.
- Implement a balance/naturalize function.

- Add some kind of safeguard against memory overflows.
- Determine sequence of operations to turn given tiling into a self-dual one.
- Function to revert to default settings.

- More display list generators.
- Options to change defaults for group setting on input (as in Systre.)
- Draw tiles and dual tiles in one image.
- Better Macintosh support (desktop shortcuts and such.)
- Draw polyhedra.
- Relax face shapes to approximate minimal surfaces.
- Add transparency.
